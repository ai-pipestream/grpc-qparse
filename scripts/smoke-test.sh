# Boot-proofs a grpc-qparse image: a green build is not "done" until the
# artifact starts under the flags it ships with. Hermetic (no documents, no
# network beyond the docker socket), so it runs in CI and before any push.
#
#   1. closure: every shared library the binary links resolves inside the
#      image. The runtime base carries no ldd and may carry no shell, so the
#      dynamic loader answers directly: LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 makes it
#      print the closure and exit, which is all ldd does.
#   2. boot: the server reaches its own "listening on" line under the
#      hardened run flags (read-only rootfs, no capabilities), which also
#      proves the engine found its font resources, and runs as uid 65532.
#   3. notices: the license texts the image redistributes are in it.
