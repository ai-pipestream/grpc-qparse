# Turns the per-platform images a publish run pushed by digest into the
# tagged manifest list the public name points at, then proves the result.
#
# The publish workflow builds every platform leg with provenance and SBOM
# attestations and pushes it by digest only (no tag), boot-proofs that
# digest, and hands the digests that passed to this script. Nothing is
# visible under a public tag until this script names it, so the smoke gate
# always runs before publication and the attestations built into each leg
# travel into the manifest list untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   publish-manifests.sh --version VERSION \
#       --platforms linux/amd64[,linux/arm64] \
#       --repo REPO [--repo REPO ...] DIGEST...
#
#   VERSION   the extra release tag, or '' to publish only :latest
#   REPO      a repository the digests were pushed to
#             (docker.io/pipestreamai/grpc-qparse); each repository gets its
#             own manifest list from its own copies, which is what
#             `docker buildx imagetools create` requires
#   DIGEST    one sha256 per platform, in any order
#
# For each repository it runs `docker buildx imagetools create` with every
# tag the run owns (latest, and VERSION when given) over REPO@DIGEST sources,
# then inspects the published index and fails unless it lists exactly the
# requested platforms and carries one attestation manifest per platform. The
# docker binary comes from PATH, so a test can stand in a fake one.
